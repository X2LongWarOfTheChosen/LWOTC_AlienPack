# Contributing
Due to the large number of people working on this project, it is important to
ensure consistent coding standards. If you don't want your changes to get stuck
in PR hell, please do all of the following

## When contributing, please
### One change at a time
If you start working on unrelated tickets, there should be a unique PR for each
of them. In order to do this it's recommended that you create a unique branch
off the head of dev for each ticket you work on. When that is done submit a PR to
the X2LongWarOfTheChosen repo, comparing your branch to the master branch.

### Follow coding style
* use the code style that is generally used in the XCOM 2 codebase:
  * Use tabs
  * Use new lines for braces
  * Use appropriate spacing, watch out whitespace changes on unrelated lines
  * Use braces even for one-line if/else bodies

The following code should illustrate all of this:
```
    static function CompleteStrategyFromTacticalTransfer()
    {
    	local XComOnlineEventMgr EventManager;
    	local array<X2DownloadableContentInfo> DLCInfos;
    	local int i;

    	UpdateSkyranger();
    	CleanupProxyVips();
    	ProcessMissionResults();
    	SquadTacticalToStrategyTransfer();

    	EventManager = `ONLINEEVENTMGR;
    	DLCInfos = EventManager.GetDLCInfos(false);
    	for (i = 0; i < DLCInfos.Length; ++i)
    	{
    		DLCInfos[i].OnPostMission();
    	}
    }
```

# Troubleshooting
For any troubleshooting direct your questions to any of the senior devs on the
discord.
