Alien Pack mod for XCOM2
Port of Pavonis Interactive's Alien Pack for LWOTC
http://www.pavonisinteractive.com/

This mod adds a series of new alien and ADVENT enemies to the campaign:

* Muton Centurion, a Muton leader with the ability to inspire its allies
* Muton Elite, a powerful Muton who can dominate in battle
* ADVENT Drone, a small, nimble crowd-control robot that hunts for hidden enemies
* Naja, an alien sharpshooter related to the Viper
* Sidewinder, a speedy alien skirmisher related to the Viper
* Sectoid Commander, a stronger sectoid with area-of-effect abilities
* ADVENT MEC Archer, a mechanized unit built to bombard at long ranges
* Hive Queen, a monstrously large and dangerous Chryssalid
* ADVENT Sentry, a soldier specializing in overwatch abilities
* ADVENT Grenadier, a soldier with a grenade launcher
* ADVENT Rocketeer, a soldier with a rocket launcher
* ADVENT Gunner, a suppression specialist
* Many of these have upgraded versions that appear later in the campaign, and the mod includes upgraded Vipers and Archons as well, for a total of 29 new enemies for you to face.

The mod also includes an ini-configurable system to build and color new types of ADVENT troopers using base-game parts. Some aliens can also be recolored with this system. The ini file that manages this is XComLWOTC_AlienVariations.
